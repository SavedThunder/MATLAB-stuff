Problem 2:
One cannot move up and down or rotate
One can't move down but it can rotate
s = w/2zl equation = for stress
x = 25
L = 40
min stress = -84375

Problem 3:
Same beam only deflection
symbolic equation for deflection
diff
find critical points - One is on the beam the other is off the beam
23.1836
51.8614
plot so that it is positive porabola

Problem 4:
Monthly/Yearly 
Find the rate as you put in
find diff of some function

Int = integration
int02pi = int(vel,'Theta',0,2*pi)
int0pi = int(vel,'Theta',0,pi)
Integral = int(x,y,bound1,bound2)

deltaT/3(f(1) + 4f(1.5) + 2f(2) + 4f(2.5) + 2f(3))
